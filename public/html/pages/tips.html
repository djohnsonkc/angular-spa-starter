	<h2>Prioritize visible content (aka "above the fold" content)</h2>

	<p>
		This site offers some good guidance on how to prioritize the visible content (aka "above the fold" content) of your site so that a user doesn't have to wait for non-essential portions of your page to load.

	<h3>What we did</h3>

	<p>
		This trick increased our Google Developers PageSpeed Insights ranking from a 79/100 to a 91/100 with one simple change. In our index.html page, we removed the link to our single CSS file and pasted the contents of our /public/css/dist/app.min.css directly into the head of our index.html page. This elminated the need for a user's browser to load the separate CSS file before rending the page.
